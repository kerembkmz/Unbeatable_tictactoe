# Tic Tac Toe Game
This is a simple command-line based Tic Tac Toe game implemented in C# using the Raylib library for graphics.

## Description
I recently spent quite some time on a chess bot project, there I came across Minimax Algorithm with alpha-beta pruning. So I wanted to use it to create an unbeatable Tic Tac Toe bot. I believe rules are self explenatory, so, good luck.

### Features
1. Player vs. Bot gameplay.
2. Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning for the bot's moves.
3. Simple and intuitive user interface
Keeps track of the player and bot scores, as well as the number of draws.
4. Allows the player to reset the game after a win, draw, or loss

### How to play
To make a move, left-click on an empty cell on the board with your mouse and wait, the bot will respond in no time.


### Prerequisites
To run this program, you need to have the .NET Core SDK and Raylib installed on your system.

### How to Run
1. Ensure you have the .NET Core SDK installed.
2. Download or clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project's root directory.
4. Build the project using the following ~command: dotnet build
Run the game using the following command: ~dotnet run
The game window will open, and you can start playing Tic Tac Toe against the bot!
